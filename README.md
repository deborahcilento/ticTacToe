Overview
- The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid of squares.   
- There are two players: X and O.   
- Players take turns placing their marker (X or O)     
- The first player to get 3 markers in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins.   

Roadmap for Future Improvements   

- Add restart button to reset game
- Improve UI/styling
- Add score tracking across multiple games
- Stop user from selecting a tile that has already been marked
